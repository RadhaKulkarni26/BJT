# BJT
### BJT is a 3 terminal semiconductor device used as a switch or to amplify, rectify and control electrical signals. It is mainly used as a switch in digital electronic applications and as an amplifier in analog electronic applications. The 3 terminals of BJTs are emitter, base, and collector. Each terminal has different doping concentrations. Based on this doping concentration it is divided into 2 types NPN and PNP.
